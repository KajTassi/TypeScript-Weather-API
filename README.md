This repository was built using ReactJS, TypeScript and TailwindCSS. I wanted an oppurtunity to practice using more TypeScript (as opposed to JavaScript) while also practicing working with an API. Because weather APIs are common, it was easier to reference documentation on how to get it done, but I am looking forward to designing a more complex TypeScript project in the future.

## API Calls

This application uses the API from https://openweathermap.org/. Their website also includes a guide on how to work with their weather API, and is free to use.
