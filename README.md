This repository was built using ReactJS, TypeScript and TailwindCSS. I wanted an oppurtunity to practice using more TypeScript (as opposed to JavaScript) while also practicing working with an API. Weather API's are pretty standard to do as projects so I thought it would be a good oppurtunity to practice TypeScript and to work with a third party API. I am looking forward to designing a more complex TypeScript project in the future.

## API Calls

This application uses the API from https://openweathermap.org/. Their website also includes a guide on how to work with their weather API, and is free to use.

## Deploying Locally

If you would like to deploy this on your computer, download this git repository and then run npm install on your machine. After downloading, you will want to run npm i to install dependancies; and then npm run start to run the application on your local server.
